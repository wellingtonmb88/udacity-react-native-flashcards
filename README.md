# udacity-react-native-flashcards

## Project overview
For the Flashcards Mobile project, I built a mobile app (Android) that allows users to study a collection of flashcards. With the app, users will be able to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, and make the quizes in these decks.


## TL;DR
- Only for Android.

To get started:
 - First install all project dependencies: cd Flashcards npm install
 - Run the WebSite: yarn start or npm start
 - Run the tests: npm run test 
 - Run the tests with code coverage: npm run test -- --coverage
